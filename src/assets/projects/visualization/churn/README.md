# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview
Machine learning model to predict customer churn with 92% accuracy, helping reduce customer attrition by 15% through proactive retention strategies.

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses. This project aims to:
- Identify customers at risk of churning
- Understand key factors driving churn
- Develop targeted retention strategies
- Reduce customer attrition by 15%

## Data Source
- Customer dataset with 10,000+ records
- Features include: demographics, usage patterns, payment history
- Target variable: churn status (0/1)
- Time period: 12 months of historical data

## Key Features Analyzed
1. **Demographic Factors**
   - Age, gender, location
   - Customer tenure
   - Subscription type

2. **Usage Patterns**
   - Monthly usage frequency
   - Feature adoption rate
   - Session duration
   - Peak usage times

3. **Financial Indicators**
   - Monthly charges
   - Payment method
   - Billing cycle
   - Late payment history

4. **Service Quality**
   - Support ticket frequency
   - Resolution time
   - Customer satisfaction scores
   - Service disruptions

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 89%
- **Recall**: 94%
- **F1-Score**: 91%

## Key Findings
1. **High-Risk Indicators**
   - Customers with >3 support tickets/month
   - Usage decline >50% in last 30 days
   - Payment delays >7 days
   - Age group 25-35 most likely to churn

2. **Retention Opportunities**
   - Proactive outreach reduces churn by 40%
   - Personalized offers increase retention by 25%
   - Early intervention saves 60% of at-risk customers

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis**: SQL, Python, Pandas
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Power BI, Matplotlib
- **Deployment**: Azure ML, REST API
